# 1. Data Overview
The dataset, named happiness.csv, contains 2,363 entries across 11 columns, representing various metrics related to happiness across 165 countries and multiple years. The columns include indicators such as Life Ladder (happiness score), Log GDP per capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom to Make Life Choices, Generosity, Perceptions of Corruption, Positive Affect, and Negative Affect. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of factors influencing happiness and life satisfaction globally.

# 2. Analysis Conducted
Descriptive Statistics: Key measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentile values were calculated for all numerical columns.

Correlation Analysis: Relationships between happiness scores (Life Ladder) and other indicators were examined to identify key drivers of happiness.

Exploration of Coverage: The dataset was found to represent data from 165 unique countries, offering a diverse global perspective.

# 3. Insights Discovered
Economic Wealth: A strong positive correlation (0.78) was observed between Log GDP per capita and Life Ladder, indicating that wealthier nations tend to report higher happiness levels.

Social Support: With a correlation of 0.72, social structures and community support were identified as critical contributors to happiness.

Health and Freedom: Healthy Life Expectancy (0.71) and Freedom to Make Life Choices (0.54) showed significant positive associations with happiness, emphasizing the role of health and autonomy in life satisfaction.

Generosity: While Generosity had a weaker positive correlation (0.18) with happiness, its impact was less pronounced compared to other factors.

Negative Drivers: Negative correlations with happiness were identified, particularly with Perceptions of Corruption (-0.43) and Negative Affect (-0.35), suggesting that societal challenges undermine overall well-being.
