# Analysis Report

## Dataset Overview
I have a dataset containing 2363 records with the following attributes: Country name, year, Life Ladder, Log GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy at birth, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of corruption, Positive affect, and Negative affect. The dataset provides information related to global happiness indicators and their correlations with various socio-economic factors.
Key attributes include:
1. **Life Ladder**: A measure of subjective well-being or happiness.
2. **Log GDP per capita**: Indicates the economic prosperity of a nation.
3. **Social support**: Reflects the community's support level for individuals.
4. **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Indicates the overall health and longevity of a population.
5. **Freedom to make life choices**: A measure of personal freedom concerning life choices made by individuals.

The dataset contains 2363 rows and 11 columns, providing insights into the data attributes and patterns.
1. Missing data is present in several critical columns, such as Log GDP per capita (28 missing), Social support (13 missing), Healthy life expectancy at birth (63 missing), Freedom to make life choices (36 missing), Generosity (81 missing), Perceptions of corruption (125 missing), Positive affect (24 missing), and Negative affect (16 missing).
2. The maximum entries for year are from 2005 to 2023, indicating a time span that reflects changes over nearly two decades in happiness metrics.

## Analysis Summary
- **Pairplot**: The pairplot displays distributions for individual variables on the diagonal and scatter plots off-diagonal highlighting relationships. Key relationships include:
   - Strong positive correlation between Life Ladder and Log GDP per capita.
   - Other notable correlations between Life Ladder and Social support, suggesting that higher societal support improves overall happiness.
  
- **Boxplot**: The boxplots show the distribution and presence of potential outliers in numeric data. The 'Life Ladder' typically has a normal distribution, but there are outlier values for variables like Generosity and Negative affect, indicating variability in these metrics across countries.

- **Heatmap**: The heatmap reveals correlations among numeric variables, showing:
   - High positive correlations between Life Ladder, Social support, and Healthy life expectancy at birth.
   - A notable negative correlation between Perceptions of corruption and Life Ladder, indicating that higher perceptions of corruption may lead to lower happiness scores.

- **Statistical Overview**:
   - Descriptive statistics highlight the mean Life Ladder score as approximately 5.48, suggesting moderate happiness levels worldwide.
   - The Log GDP per capita shows a mean of approximately 9.40, with significant variation (std deviation of about 1.15).
   - Key metric interactions can be observed where increased GDP per capita is associated with higher happiness (Life Ladder), indicating important socio-economic trends.

- **Overall Analysis**: The analysis revealed varying distributions of unique values, especially in metrics such as Generosity, which demonstrated more skewed distributions. 

## Key Insights
1. The dataset suggests that economic factors such as GDP and social support are significant drivers of overall happiness levels, as indicated by the strong correlations.
2. Increased Freedom to make life choices tends to correlate positively with Life Ladder scores but reflects a considerable variation across different countries. 

## Implications of Findings
- Countries may consider enhancing social support programs and economic policies aimed at boosting GDP per capita to improve happiness levels.
- Addressing corruption perceptions and fostering more egalitarian freedom may provide additional pathways to enhance citizens' sense of well-being.
- There are opportunities for optimization by focusing on the variables identified as significantly influencing happiness, especially social support and economic factors, thereby enabling targeted interventions.
